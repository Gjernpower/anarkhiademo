Anarkhia Readme (v1.0.0):

<b>Introduction:</b>

Hi friends, thanks for taking the time out to try out this little demo/prototype I've been working on for a while now. Really the primary aim for this project was for me to familiarise myself with GameMaker Studio 2 as well as understanding coding & programming in general. However, I hope this does serve as proof of concept of a possible full game in future, and I will be working on this and adding features as time goes by.

This is a weird rhythm-based RPG inspired by games like Brutal Legend, Crypt of the Necrodancer, Patapon, Guitar Hero and Final Fantasy. Please feel free to leave a comment or let me know what you like, what you don't, and what you think should be improved! Welcome to Anarkhia, enjoy your stay.

<i>p.s. I recommend choosing "Seven" and "Army" when prompted for the first time to choose a song.</i>

<b>Description:</b>

Just <i>HOW</i> hard did you party last night? One moment you're chugging root beer with your bandmates, and the next you wake up covered in grass, strange creatures dancing around you. In your head is a faint ticking noise, a metronome, beckoning you to play to the beat. As you reach for your instrument, arcane energy pulses through your body, and you ready yourself for the performance of a lifetime.

- Innovative gameplay that combines turn-based RPG combat (Final Fantasy) and rhythm games (Guitar Hero).
- Take control of multiple band members and play different parts to create your own mixes and mashups.
- Skill trees and equipment choices reflect how you want your band to play.
- Explore Anarkhia, a world divided into factions, with each following a different sub-genre of rock. Learn their ways and their music to achieve greater musical mastery.
